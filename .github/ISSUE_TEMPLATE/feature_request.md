**Suggestion Description**
I Personally Believe it would be a great idea if businesses could "turn on their Open Sign" by means of turning on and off their Blimp on the GPS.

**Reason**
This would Help with screen clutter on the map as well as giving people and idea if a business is actually open. it would stop people from spamming twitter with "is anyone from [insert Business Here] around". adding more QOL as well for people that drive all the way to a certain business just to be disapointed by it not actually being open. one reason i am suggesting this is due to the fact that not everyone takes down their YP ad, and not to mention some people will go to the location first without calling.

**Additional context**
one of the last servers i played on had this for businesses, if you saw the gps blimp for that business there, you knew it was open. employees would only have to type /open and /close.
